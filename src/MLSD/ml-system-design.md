### Designing ML systems for production

Deploying deep learning models in production can be challenging, and it is beyond training models with good performance. Several distinct components need to be designed and developed in order to deploy a production level deep learning system.

Approaching an ML system design problem follows a similar logical flow to the generic software system design. (
For more insight on general system design interview you can e.g. check out [Grokking the System Design Interview
](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
and [System design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).). However, there are certain components in the design of an ML based system that needs to be addressed and need special attention, as you will see below in ML System Design Flow.

### ML System Design Interview 

- In an ML system design interview you are exposed to open ended questions with no single correct answer.
- The goal of ML system design interview is evaluate your your ability to zoom out and design a production-level ML system that can be deployed as a service within a company's ML infrastructure.

# 1. The 9-Step ML System Design Formula ([Template](./mlsd-template.md)) 

In order to design a solid ML system for real world applications, it is important to follow a design flow.
I recommend using the following **9-Step ML System Design Formula** to design SW system solutions for ML-relevant business problems both at work and during interviews:

</center>

Note: Remember when using this design flow during an interview to be flexible. According to the needs of the interview or the interests of the interviewer, you may skip some of these components or spend more time for a deep dive in one or two components.  

## 1. Problem Formulation

- Clarifying questions
- Use case(s) and business goal
- Requirements
  - Scope (features needed), scale, and personalization
  - Performance: prediction latency, scale of prediction
  - Constraints
  - Data: sources and availability  
- Assumptions

- Translate an abstract problem into an ML problem
  - ML objective,
  - ML I/O,
  - ML category (e.g.  binary classification, multi-classification, unsupervised learning, etc)
- Do we need ML to solve this problem?
  - Trade off between impact and cost
    - Costs: Data collection, data annotation, compute
    - if Yes, we choose an ML system to design. If No, follow a general system design flow.  
    - Note: in an ML system design interview we can assume we need ML.

## 2. Metrics (Offline and Online)

- Offline metrics (e.g. classification, relevance metrics)  
  - Classification metrics
    - Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC, P/R AUC, mAP, log-loss, etc

    - Natural labels (extracted from data e.g. clicks, likes, purchase, etc)
      - Missing negative labels (not clicking is not a negative label):
        - Negative sampling
    - Explicit user feedback
    - Human annotation (super costly, slow, privacy issues)
  - Handling lack of labels
  - Programmatic labeling methods (noisy, pros: cost, privacy, adaptive)
