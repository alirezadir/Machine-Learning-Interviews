# <a name="ml-sys"></a>  5. Machine Learning System Design

## Designing ML systems for production
This is one of my favorite interviews in which you can shine bright and up-level your career. I'd like to mention the following important notes:

- Remember, the goal of ML system design interview is NOT to measure your deep and detailed knowledge of different ML algorithms, but your ability to zoom out and design a production-level ML system that can be deployed as a service within a company's ML infrastructure.

- Deploying deep learning models in production can be challenging, and it is beyond training models with good performance. Several distinct components need to be designed and developed in order to deploy a production level deep learning system.

# 1. ML System Design Flow
Approaching an ML system design problem follows a similar flow to the generic software system design.
For more insight on general system design interview you can e.g. check out [Grokking the System Design Interview
](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
and [System design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

I developed the following design flow that worked pretty well during my own interviews:

1. Problem Formulation 
    - What does it mean? 
    - Use cases 
    - Requirements
    - Assumptions 
    - Do we need ML to solve this problem? 
    -   Trade off between impact and cost
        -   Costs: Data collection, data annotation, compute 
        - if Yes, go to the next topic. If No, follow a general system design flow. 
3. ML Metrics (Offline and Online)
      - Accuracy metrics: 
          - imbalanced data?
      - Latency 
      - Problem specific metric (e.g. CTR)

5. MVP Logic (High Level Design)
    - Model based vs rule based logic 
        - Pros and cons, and decision 
          -  Note: Always start as simple as possible and iterate over 
    - Propose a simple model (e.g. a binary logistic regression classifier)
    
4. Data Pipeline 
    - Needs 
        - type (e.g. image, text, video, etc) and volume
    - Sources
        - availability and cost 
    - Labelling (if needed)
      - labeling cost  
    - Feature Generation 
      - what to chose as and how to chose features 
      - feature representation 

6. Training 
      - data splits (train, dev, test)
        - portions
        - how to chose a test set 
      - debugging 
    - Iterate over MVP model (if needed)
      - data augmentation  

7. Inference (online)
    - Data processing and verification 
    - Prediction module 
    - Serving infra 
    - Web app 

8. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates 
    - Scaling for increased demand (same as in distributed systems)
      - Scaling web app and serving system 
      - Data partitioning 
    - Data parallelism 
    - Model parallelism 
    - A/B test and deployment
      - How to A/B test? 
      - what portion of users?
      - control and test groups 

# ML System Design Sample Questions 

# ML System Design Topics
I observed there are certain sets of topics that are frequently brought up or can be used as part of the logic of the system. Here are some of the important ones:

### Recommendation Systems
- Collaborative Filtering (CF)
    - user based, item based
    - Cold start problem
    - Matrix factorization
- Content based filtering

### NLP

- Preprocessing
  - Normalization, tokenization, stop words
- Word Embeddings
  - Word2Vec, GloVe, Elmo, BERT
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- NLP specialist topics:
  - Language Modeling
  - Part of speech tagging
  - POS HMM
    - Viterbi algorithm and beam search
  - Named entity recognition
  - Topic modeling
  - Speech Recognition Systems
    - Feature extraction, MFCCs
    - Acoustic modeling
      - HMMs for AM
      - CTC algorithm (advanced)
    - Language modeling
      - N-grams vs deep learning models (trade-offs)
      - Out of vocabulary problem
  - Dialog and chatbots
    - [CMU lecture on chatbots](http://tts.speech.cs.cmu.edu/courses/11492/slides/chatbots_shrimai.pdf)
    - [CMU lecture on spoken dialogue systems](http://tts.speech.cs.cmu.edu/courses/11492/slides/sds_components.pdf)
  - Machine Translation
    - Seq2seq models, NMT

Note: The reason I have more topics here is because this was my focus in my own interviews

### Ads and Ranking
- CTR prediction
- Ranking algorithms

### Information retrieval
- Search
  - Pagerank
  - Autocomplete for search

### Computer vision
- Image classification
- Object Tracking
- Popular architectures (AlexNet, VGG, ResNET)
- [TBD]

### Transfer learning
- Why and when to use transfer learning
- How to do it
  - depending on the dataset sizes and similarities

Once you learn about the basics, I highly recommend checking out different companies blogs on ML systems. You can refer to some of those resources in the subsection [ML at Companies](#ml-at-companies) below.
